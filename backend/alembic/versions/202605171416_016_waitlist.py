"""waitlist (legacy migration 016_waitlist.sql)

Wraps backend/migrations/016_waitlist.sql verbatim -- see backend/migrations/README.md
for why the original .sql files are kept as the source of truth rather than
inlined here. This revision predates Alembic's adoption; it is baselined
(`alembic stamp`) on every existing database rather than re-executed.

Revision ID: 016_waitlist
Revises: 015_insurance_policies
