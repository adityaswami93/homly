"""insurance document (legacy migration 017_insurance_document.sql)

Wraps backend/migrations/017_insurance_document.sql verbatim -- see backend/migrations/README.md
for why the original .sql files are kept as the source of truth rather than
inlined here. This revision predates Alembic's adoption; it is baselined
(`alembic stamp`) on every existing database rather than re-executed.

Revision ID: 017_insurance_document
Revises: 016_reminders
