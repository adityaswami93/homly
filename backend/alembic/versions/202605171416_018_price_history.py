"""price history (legacy migration 018_price_history.sql)

Wraps backend/migrations/018_price_history.sql verbatim -- see backend/migrations/README.md
for why the original .sql files are kept as the source of truth rather than
inlined here. This revision predates Alembic's adoption; it is baselined
(`alembic stamp`) on every existing database rather than re-executed.

Revision ID: 018_price_history
Revises: 017_custom_commands
